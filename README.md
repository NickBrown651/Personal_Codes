Roman Numerals:

  1. You put the Roman numeral to convert.

  2. The code reads the full length of the string.

  3. It then starts reading each one of the chars and if the letter is a combination (such as 'I' with 'X'), then the code saves that information and goes to the correct if.

  4. At each iteration, an add variable stores the numbers.

  5. Finally, a print shows the total add variable with the final number.
